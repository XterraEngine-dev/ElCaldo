    <string name="coffe_main">Coffee is a legend , known for
    Muslims and Christians. A religious talk that level in a
    time there was a prophet who was ill , the angel Gabriel them
    gave back health and virility , offering a black drink
    as the great black stone in Mecca."\n\n"

    As this legend run many others stress the importance
    which it has been attributed to coffee throughout human history."\n\n"

    What seems certain is that coffee began to consume in
    altiplaniecies of Abyssinia, where it grew wild its
    mode called Arabica."\n\n"

    Ethiopia went to Saudi and India , probably through
    of musumlamnes pilgrims traveling to Mecca , as routes
    pilgrimage were at the same time , for centuries , great routes
    commercial."\n\n"

    But the great propagators of coffee were the Dutch, who
    They exploded large plantations of it in their colonies of Ceylon
    and Indonesia."\n\n"

    They were the importers of coffee and those who calimatarón in
    Botanical Gardens Amsterdam , Paris and London , where
    He happened to the Dutch Guyana , Brazil, Central America and other
    many countries. Thanks to which in three centuries this infusion has
    gone from being almost unknown to become a universal beverage
    Bach , Beethoven ,, Balzac , Goldoni , Napoléon, rossini , Voltaire
    and many other characters in the story have consumed in large
    quantity and praised beyond measure."\n\n"</string>

    <string name="origin_coffe_text">Coffee plants are native to
    ancient Ethiopia in the Republic of Yemen."\n\n"

    It is easy to be confused with the true origin of the coffee as ancient legends
    on the culture and custom of coffee comes from Arabia."\n\n"

    One of the earliest written references to coffee making is called
    "The Success of Coffee " ( The success of coffee) , escirto by a sensitive man
    originally from Mecca called Abu - Bek in the early fifteenth century and translated into
    French in 1699 by Antoine de Gailland , the same who translated "Thousand and One Arabian Nights" ( The Arabian Nights )."\n\n"

    The strongest and most accepted legend about coffee descubriimiento
    and drink coffee is referenced to a shepherd named Kaldi .
    The legend says that Kaldi noticed the strange behavior
    his goats were jumping around very excited and full of energy.
    The bush that Kaldi thought his goats had eaten the fruit ,
    They had as fruits like cherries . Then Kaldi decided to try
    bush leaves and after a while felt full of energy."\n\n"

   Kaldi then took some fruits and branches of the shrub to a monastery.
    There Abad told the story of the goats and how he had felt
    after Commodian leaves . The Abbot decided to cook the branches
    and cherries ; the result was a very bitter drink that he pulled
    fire immediately . When the cherries fell into the coals began to boil,
    green peas that were produced inside a delicious aroma
    that made the aband think about making a drink based on
    roasted coffee , and this is how the coffee drink was born."\n\n"</string>

    <string name="consumo_cultivo_text">The Arabs were the first to
    discover the virtues and economic possibilities of coffee. This
    It was because they developed the whole process of growing and processing
    coffee and kept it a secret. The Arabs also tried
    to avoid the extradition of any seed of coffee."\n\n"

    The coffee began to conquer territory in the world as the drink
    favorite in Europe and arrived in Italy in 1645 courtesy of the merchant
    Venetian Pietro Della Valle . England began taking coffee
    1650 thanks to the merchant Daniel Edwards , who was the first
    which opened a retail coffee in England and Europe."\n\n"

    Another author, H.J.E. Jacob says that coffee as a beverage in Europe
    begins in Vienna with the invasion by Turkish low
    the command of Kara- Mustafa . Jacob also gives credit to a hero
    time , Josef Koltschitzky , to open the first " Cafe " in September
    12, 1683 in the city center of Vienna."\n\n"

    Coffee arrived in France through the Port of Marcella . in 1660
    some traders that port who knew the coffee, their
    attributes and effects for their travels around the world , decided
    take a few sacks from Egypt and by 1661 the first
    coffee shop was opened in Marcella."\n\n"

    History points to Soliman Aga , the ambassador of Persia in Paris
    during the reign of Louis XIV, as the first to introduce coffee
    in the Monarchy and the high French society."\n\n"

    The first coffee shop in Paris was opened to the public in 1672
    by Pascal Armeniano along the traditional avenue
    Saint German . A Sicilian named Procopio opened a shop
    Similarly nearby, where they gathered around the exquisite taste
    coffee , many of the best examples of Parisian society.
    In 1689 Procopio traladó your coffee shop to a place near the Theater
    the French Comedy dodne prospered and finally ended when already
    He was known throughout Paris ."\n\n"</string>

    <string name="recoleccion_text">It is with the collection of cherries
    ( The futos of Arabica or Canephora ) starting long
    Coffee way."\n\n"

    The Picking is a completely manual method and is to boot
    one by one only the perfectly ripe cherries. Thus
    a homogeneous set of good quality is obtained."\n\n"

    The stripping is to collect , with threshing machines or by hand , all
    the crezas once. Cerner is necessary on the harvest , since
    that green or already fermented cherries are collected together with the
    mature ."\n\n"

    **The benefit of coffee**"\n"

    From the collection centers coffee reaches the stage of
    benefit to extract coffee beans fruit ,
    removing the pulp and the film . Upon completion of this phase,
    You can divide the cafes in specific commercial types,
    conformity with international classifications."\n\n"

    There are different types of treatments:"\n"

    With the wet mill , used for coffee varieties more
    fine , a product called washing or mild coffee is obtained.
    His appearance is uniform and flawless. This treatment requires
    cherries maturity and homogeneous consistency : a machine the
    dispulpa , separating the skin ( exocarp ) of the grains
    subsequently placed in water tanks last one or two days
    to ferment . Once free of mucilage , grains are
    ready to be washed and dried in the sun or in mechanical dryers
    temperature of 45-60 °."\n\n"

    The coffee thus obtained retains some protective membranes
    ( The parchment and the silver film) are removed with a machine
    called hulling . Green beans , once peeled ,
    They are ready to be picked in well ventilated warehouses."\n\n"

    With the dry mill called natural coffees are obtained
    Uneven aspect . Immediately after collection ,
    the fruits are placed in layers and allowed to air for two or
    three weeks. Sun exposure and action of separate machines
    grain pulp as both of the two protective membranes ."\n\n"

    The system has the semi-washed characterized by lower water consumption
    relative to the wet method . The cherries are pulped by a
    machine that removes both skin ( exocarp ) as pulp (mesocarp ) .
    The coffee thus obtained is dried in the sun or in dryers."\n\n"

    On the ground , this process is monitored constantly , from
    arrival Storage space green coffee until the finished product."\n\n"</string>

    <string name="tueste_text">With roasted beans undergo
    transformation : change color , they lose weight , increase in volume
    and acquire aroma. High tempraturas allow
    grains develop its aromatic characteristics."\n\n"

    * A 100 C are golden brown and give off an odor similar to the plan
    toasted , which will soon become the sublime aroma of coffee ."\n\n"

    * Above 150-180 C are larger, bright and color
    Brown."\n\n"

    * A 200-230 C roasting is at the optimum level and coffee
    acquires its typical taste . Once removed from the toaster , coffee
    rapidly cooled with cold air flows."\n\n"

    Long cycles are designed for blends for espresso , with
    In order to obtain a creamy beverage and one harmonious taste."\n\n"

    Mixtures of different grains are an element in which the
    coffee culture finds its ultimate exresión . essential for
    get a quality drink , the best blends born of
    union of different varieties of coffee, including five or six at a time."\n\n"

    For example , those comprise only Arabica are sweeter and
    fragrant , while those formed by arabica and robusta have
    more body and a strong flavor."\n\n"

    The variety of coffees from our farms allow create a
    endless different blends of flavor and fragrance: full and
    chocolaty , or fragrant , perfumed acidulous when
    Arabica prevail."\n\n"

    Careful grinding"\n"

    The fineness of grind coffee cabia resistance over water ,
    affecting the extraction rate and thus the
    caracteríticas organoleptic beverage in the cup , any
    that the mode of preparation."\n\n"

    Storage and packaging"\n"

    Again experience and effort towards
    excellence has led us to develop specific ténicas . For
    prevent ground coffee deteriorates to contact
    air , prior to packaging , the product is stored in a
    space with controlled atmosphere. This guarantees the
    antipidrido total dispersion of carbon is very short time,
    without altering the fragrance."\n\n"

    Both grain and powdered coffee to be packaged for
    keeps intact its organoleptic caracteristics therefore
    the choice of material and the packaging is ténica
    determinant."\n\n"</string>

    <string name="cafe_mundo_text">In platanción"\n"

    Coffee grows on small evergreen trees on plantations in South and
    Central America , Africa and Asia."\n\n"

    As require the right amount of sunlight and shade , regular watering ,
    fertilizers and pest and weed control , young coffee trees
    demand constant attention of farmers. They can
    take up to four years for a coffee tree to reach its production
    mature . Once this stage is reached , trees CFE , handled
    well , they can be maintained for up to 40 years ."\n\n"

    Arabica and Robusta"\n"

    Among the approximately 60 existenetes coffee species , Arabica and Robusta
    They are used for commercial purposes and preparation . Robusta ,
    that from a botanical point of view is a variety of Canephora , is
    grown at low altitude relative to sea level near
    800m ( also influenced by latitude ) . Robusta characterized by
    a strong note , strong body and very little acidity. Grown
    mainly in Vietnam , Brazil and Indonesia. Arabica grows at higher
    altitude , usually above 800 meters and up to 2500 meters. It includes
    several varieties known as Bourbon . Tipica , Caturra , Cutuai ,
    Catimor , Mundo Novo , Colombia , etc.
    Arabica is characterized by fine aroma, less body, and pleasant acidity .
    Brazil, Colombia , Ethiopia , Central America, Mexico , India, East Africa
    It is among the products Arabica countries best known."\n\n"

    Selection of grains"\n"

    Once coffee trees begin to produce fruit, is
    They require about nine months for the fruit to ripen in red cherries.
    Coffee still continues to collect by hand. For best quality , only
    ripe red cherries are selected, not djeando cherries
    mature on the branches to harvest later. As each tree
    we visit several times during the Temprado , this is a method
    more expensive. Alternatively, the farmer can decide the
    time to harvest and then collect in each tree drawing
    green and ripe cherries . To do this the gathering ersona
    Slide your hands along the branches , letting cherries
    ciagan in a basket or canvas stretched under the tree , where
    They are collected. This is more efficient but results in lower quality
    general."\n\n"

    Preparation of green beans"\n"

    Fresh coffee beans must dry before roasting .
    There are two ways to prepare coffee beans : the "dry" method
    and the " wet " method . With the dry method , fresh red cherries
    harvested are distributed on special mats and left
    dried in the sun for two to three weeks. Once dry , the part
    External cherries are mechanically removed from the coffee bean
    Green. With the " wet" method , a machine pulper is used for
    remove the outer pulp cherries . The resulting " parchment coffee "
    it ferments and rinsed to remove any residual pulp.
    Then the parchment coffee beans for flaking."\n\n"

    Selection of grains"\n"

    At this stage, coffee beans have a greenish hue
    by what are known as " green beans " without taste or odor
    the typical coffee. Before storing in sacks and send others
    countries , the green beans are classified , measured and checked for
    ensure a high- end quality. Other names
    receiving the rejected imperfect grains are Smelly ,
    Black , acids and Pintos ."\n\n"</string>

    Roasted beans"\n"

    It is not until the green beans are roasted that they release the aroma
    and the taste of coffee we all know. According to the team and roasting
    the desired flavor of brewed coffee , green beans are roasted between
    180 C 240 C for three to 12 minutes."\n\n"

    Grinding"\n"

    Before sneak , roasted coffee must be ground . milling
    increases the surface area of coffee , allowing the flavor can
    extract more easily to slip."\n\n"

    soluble coffee is made in exactly the same manner as Coffee
    Cast : beans are blended, roasted and ground before colarlo

    First Place in San Francisco exposión."\n\n"

    In 1910 Guatemalans, Dr. Federico Lehnohoff and Eduardo T.
    Gabarrus developing Fancia soluble coffee . but the first
    World War prevented the patent being marketed in
    France. The formula used is actualemnte the same , but not
    It has been improved."\n\n"

    The coffees produced in Guatemala are classified as
    " Arabic numerals Washes " , occurring in all departments have
    different characteristics by altiutd , soil type , temperature ,
    Cloudiness and government of the region where they are grown."\n\n"

    This affects the characteristics of coffee bean in size, structure and
    consistency , causing quality to be different , are differentiable
    and unique to each other."\n\n"

    This unique natural regionalization produces several unique types
    of coffee. Among the most concoidos is cuentran : Coffee Fraijanes ,
    Coffee Coban, Huehuetenango coffee , coffee Atitlan and Antigua coffee . The cafe
    Antigua is a type of coffee status recognized internationally as subject
    a surcharge on the gourmet markets."\n\n"

    It is grown in an area located between volcanoes , whose slopes form a
    valley with ecological and climatic conditions particularly
    conducive to the cultivation of the best coffee."\n\n"

    The soils of volcanic origin, are young and present conditions
    optimal fertility for grain, some national experts
    and foreigners, consider the Genuine Antigua coffee , it is one of the
    finest coffees produced in the world."\n\n"

    CROPS"\n"
    The coffee is traditionally grown under the shade of other trees
    that help preserve the environment."\n\n"

    In Guatemala grow more than 800 million coffee trees , which are
    dimensioned in 262.300 hectares of land. In turn , these plants
    are shaded coffee which provides about 30 million
    tree species such as caspirol , the cuje , the Chuchín , etc."\n\n"

    This gigantic forest artifial diriamente pours the armósfera
    the amount of 5 million tons of oxygen."\n"</string>

    <string name="tip_dev_text">Guatemala is a wonderful place to
    admire and enjoy all that our beautiful country offers . Now
    let us be clear and direct."\n\n"

    Unfortunately we are a culture that does not appreciate how good
    have here and one point where I realize that I no
    Guatemalan appreciate the excellent coffee. We have become accustomed
    to take that "instant cafectio " at any time I want to talk
    bad packet of these cafes but still , Guatemala of the best
    countries in the coffee area , because we do not know at least the
    basic and fundamental for the coffee taste properties."\n\n"

    Indeed it is curious that foreign people visiting Guatemala ,
    I asked them to name five things that they say , like e
    identify our country , they respond:"\n\n"

    - Nature."\n"
    - Color."\n"
    - Odor."\n"
    - Flavors."\n"

    And the most curious of all,"\n"

    - Coffe."\n"

    Now I say , How is it possible that people remember to Guate as
    a country of good coffee ? While we have not got the slightest idea
    of why . Well make some cultural - anthropological studies and
    because the response is overwhelming."\n\n"

    Since little has been accustomed to drink coffee which is, is
    pity to see people older , give them a good and worthy
    cup of gourmet coffee Guatemalan and the reaction of these people ,
    They make a gesture as if they were giving some sort of drink
    corrosive toxic."\n\n"

    As I mentioned this lies since we have the first contact
    we have with the world of coffee and as the time it makes you
    wont take " packet Cafecito " but today I will tell you a few
    reasons to make a good cup of coffee and you stop accepting
    any " little coffee " that offer you."\n\n"

    1. instant coffee to health level , is one of the worst things you can
    take , in fact, these envelopes by the amount of chemicals that brings
    I get are harmful to your body."\n\n"

    2. A real cup of coffee brings more properties and positive effects
    for your body , even your immune system."\n\n"

    3. As good chapín you should know at least what kind of coffee you are taking
    and that region comes."\n\n"

    4. Appreciate the crazy market, we support more the excellent work they do
    Our craftsmen farmers to maintain exquisite quality coffee ,
    pitifully the best coffee in the country is taken entities
    foreign , they put their brand , returns to the country increasing its
    exorbitant price but you think your cool by going to repay your cup
    coffee to four times its actual price."\n\n"

    Everything mentioned above is to make consciousness
    good coffee in our country , we must support it for it to stay
    with us and appreciate it as such , otherwise , as we that
    our future generations to value and develop new opportunities
    for the country."\n\n"

    I say : Appreciate nature , appreciates culture , appreciates our
    gastronomy, APPRECIATE OUR CAFE is sad to know that foreigners
    They know more about our ountry than ourselves , starting with coffee would be
    well, since, as mentioned angterioemente is the second
    most traded product in the world."\n\n"

    Extras Coffee"\n"

    Their properties and positive effects from the perception of its aroma
    and taste , coffee offers us a range of emotions resuscitating
    our physical and espirutal to savor state."\n\n"

    But it has been found to take two to three cups of good coffee
    a day helps maintain a balance at Sunrise . Between the
    benefits that can be found are , preventing certain types
    cancer and diabetes, and benefits to the circulatory system and
    respiratory. It also provides antioxidant that help delay
    aging process and stimulates memory.</string>
